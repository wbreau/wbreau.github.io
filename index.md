## D2L Instructor Widget

This LTI widget allows instructors to quickly and easily add a picture of themselves and information such as name, email address, phone number, office number, office hours, and a brief bio to their course home page. The widget uses the course OU number to query a database on the remote site. If the OU exists as a primary key in the database, the widget displays the instructor's information to the students or the information plus an edit button to the instructor. If it does not already exist in the database, then the students would see an "under construction" message and the instructor would see the form to complete with their information.
